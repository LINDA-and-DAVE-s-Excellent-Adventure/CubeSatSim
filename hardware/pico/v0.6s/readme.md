Here is information about the Beta version of the CubeSatSim Pico PCB

Changes since the v0.5 board:

- No solder paste on Pico pads
- Added wiring between SMD and through hole LED resistors, so the resistors can be SMD and the LEDs through hole
- Moved AUDIO_OUT to GPIO pin 12
- Added a cut pad on 3.3V to ESP32-CAM and a pin for 5V to try powering from 5V
- Added an open pad on GPIO pin 7 to RF
- Added U1a and U1b labels to the two parts of the Pico female sockets
- Added SQUELCH to GPIO pin 15

The files here are for a single board, the CubeSatSim Pico which replaces the STEM Payload Board and the Raspberry Pi Zero.
