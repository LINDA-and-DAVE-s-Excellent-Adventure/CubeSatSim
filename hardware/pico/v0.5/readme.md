Here is information about the Beta version of the CubeSatSim Pico PCB

Changes since the v0.4 board:

- 68 Ohm resistor SMD is now 0805
- Added cutable trace JP1 so Pico 5V is supplied through the RBF
- Moved AUDIO_OUT on GPIO to a Pi Zero PWM pin
- Moved SWTX on GPIO to Pi Zero TX pin
- Added back GPIO clock pin to RF
- Added a Pico GPIO connection to a pin to test wake for Camera
- Made solering Pico pins easier
- Moved diode D3 away from GPIO header


The files here are for a single board, the CubeSatSim Pico which replaces the STEM Payload Board and the Raspberry Pi Zero.
