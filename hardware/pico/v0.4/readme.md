Here is information about the 4th Beta version of CubeSatSim Pico PCB

 Changes from v0.3
 
- Fix soldermask on USB-C board
- Move Si5351 board up
- Make chip antenna longer
- Add SMD RBF
- Change analog switch SMD footprints to SOT-23-5 
- Fixed crystal pin 1 label
- Replace JP5 with a normally open pad on top with solder paste on it
- Solder resist on top of SMA for ground pins 
- VBUS on Pico to USB-C through Diode - red charging light will illuminate, RBF work except for when micro USB connected to Pico
- Camera connector mounted on PCB bottom


The files here are for a single board, the CubeSatSim Pico which replaces the STEM Payload Board and the Raspberry Pi Zero.
