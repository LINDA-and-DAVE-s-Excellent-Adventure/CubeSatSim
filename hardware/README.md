The current CubeSatSim hardware is in the v1.0 folder.  The folder contains gerbers, schematics, and images of the Main, Battery, and STEM Payload boards.

For information on building the boards, see https://cubesatsim.org/wiki.

Older beta versions of the hardware are in the other folders and should not be used.
