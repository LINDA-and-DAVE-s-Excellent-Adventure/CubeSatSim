Here is information about the CubeSatSim v1.1 hardware

NOTE: The change between v1.1 and v1.2 is changing the USB charging connector from a micro USB to a USB-C connector. Some labels also changed

There are files for the main board, battery board, and STEM payload board of these types:

* cubesatsim-main-1.2_gerbers.zip  --    All gerber files used to fabricate PCBs

* cubesatsim-main-1.2_schematic.pdf --   Schematic

* cubesatsim-main-1.2_pcb.png     --   View of board

* cubesatsim-main-1.2_board_fill.png --  View of board with fill

* cubesatsim-main-1.2_topPCB.png    --   Top view of PCB generated by gerbers

* cubesatsim-main-1.2_bottomPCB.png  --  Bottom view of PCB generated by gerbers

* cubesatsim-main-1.2_tNames.pdf     --  Top outline of components

* cubesatsim-main-1.2_bNames.pdf    --   Bottom outline of components
