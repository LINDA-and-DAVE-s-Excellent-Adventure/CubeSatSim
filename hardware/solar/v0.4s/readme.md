Here is information about the Beta version of the CubeSatSim Solar PCB

Changes since the v0.3 board:

- Moved U4 so that it isn't covered up by U6
- Moved bridging labels so they can be better seen
- Flipped U2 and U12 so they are the same direction as all the other ICs
- J4 test pins are now 6 pins and used on the top

The files here are for a single board, the CubeSatSim Pico which replaces the STEM Payload Board and the Raspberry Pi Zero.
