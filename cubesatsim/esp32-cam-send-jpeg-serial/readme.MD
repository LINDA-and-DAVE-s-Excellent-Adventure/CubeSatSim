This code runs on the ESP32-CAM camera module

The board is ESP32 Arduino/AI Thinker ESP32-CAM such as from here:

I follow the instructions here https://all3dp.com/2/esp32-cam-arduino-tutorial/ 

I use the ESP32-CAM MB USB programmer as described in the section "Esp32-Cam MB Micro-USB Programmer"

The Arduino IDE 1.x instructions are in the section "Installing the Esp32 Library"

Select the USB Serial port

Compile and Upload

Open the Serial Monitor at 115200 bps

The red LED on the back of the camera will flash once when it takes a photo and flashes twice when it sends it over the serial port
